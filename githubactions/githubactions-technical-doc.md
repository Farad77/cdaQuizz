# GitHub Actions Technical Documentation

## Introduction

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. It's directly integrated with GitHub repositories, making it easy to automate workflows based on GitHub events.

## Key Concepts

### Workflows
A workflow is a configurable automated process that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy your project on GitHub.

### Jobs
A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. By default, a workflow with multiple jobs will run those jobs in parallel.

### Steps
A step is an individual task that can run commands or actions. Each step in a job executes on the same runner, allowing the actions in that job to share data.

### Actions
An action is a custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex but frequently repeated task.

### Runners
A runner is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed. GitHub provides Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS runners to run your workflows; you can also host your own runners.

## Workflow File Structure

GitHub Actions workflows are defined in YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Here's a basic structure:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!
```

## Workflow Triggers

Workflows can be triggered by various GitHub events, including:
- Push
- Pull request
- Schedule (cron jobs)
- External events (webhook)
- Manual triggers

## Environment Variables and Secrets

GitHub Actions allows you to set environment variables and secrets:
- Environment variables can be set in the workflow file
- Secrets can be set in the repository settings and securely used in workflows

## Artifacts

Artifacts allow you to persist data after a job has completed, and share that data with another job in the same workflow.

## GitHub-hosted Runners

GitHub provides runners with preinstalled software and tools:
- Ubuntu Linux
- Windows Server
- macOS

## Self-hosted Runners

You can host your own runners to run workflows on your own infrastructure.

## Caching Dependencies

GitHub Actions provides caching to save time and bandwidth by reusing previously downloaded dependencies.

## Best Practices

1. Use the checkout action to access your repository code
2. Cache dependencies to speed up workflows
3. Use secrets for sensitive information
4. Keep your actions versioned
5. Use status badges in your README
6. Use concurrency to cancel redundant workflow runs

## Limitations

- Workflow run time: Limited to 6 hours
- API requests: Limited to 1000 requests per hour per repository
- Concurrent jobs: Depends on your GitHub plan
