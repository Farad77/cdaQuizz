# Puppet Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool that helps system administrators automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of servers. It uses a declarative language to describe system configuration.

## Key Concepts

### Manifests
Manifests are files where you define resources that should be managed on your nodes. They use Puppet's declarative language and have a .pp extension.

### Resources
Resources are the basic unit of modeling in Puppet. They represent a specific element of a system, like a file, package, or service.

### Classes
Classes are named blocks of Puppet code that can be distributed and then included in other manifests.

### Modules
Modules are self-contained bundles of code and data. They allow you to organize your Puppet code into reusable units.

### Nodes
Nodes are the systems managed by Puppet. This can include physical servers, virtual machines, network devices, or any other system where the Puppet agent can be installed.

## Puppet Architecture

Puppet follows a client-server model:

1. Puppet Master: Central server that stores configurations
2. Puppet Agent: Runs on nodes and applies configurations

## Writing Manifests

A simple manifest might look like this:

```puppet
file { '/tmp/example_file':
  ensure  => present,
  content => "Hello, Puppet!\n",
  owner   => 'root',
  group   => 'root',
  mode    => '0644',
}
```

## Puppet Language

### Variables
```puppet
$my_variable = "Hello, Puppet!"
```

### Conditionals
```puppet
if $operatingsystem == 'ubuntu' {
  package { 'apache2':
    ensure => installed,
  }
}
```

### Loops
```puppet
$users = ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie']
each($users) |$user| {
  user { $user:
    ensure => present,
  }
}
```

## Facter

Facter is Puppet's cross-platform system profiling library. It discovers and reports per-node facts, which are available in your Puppet manifests as variables.

## Hiera

Hiera is Puppet's built-in key-value lookup tool. It's used to separate data from code, making your Puppet code more reusable.

## Puppet Forge

Puppet Forge is a repository of pre-made modules. You can use these modules to quickly add functionality to your Puppet infrastructure.

## Best Practices

1. Use version control for your Puppet code
2. Organize your code into modules
3. Use Hiera for data separation
4. Write tests for your Puppet code
5. Use community modules when possible
6. Keep your manifests clean and readable
7. Use roles and profiles pattern for better organization

## Puppet Enterprise

Puppet Enterprise is the commercial version of Puppet. It includes additional features like a web UI, enhanced reporting, and role-based access control.
