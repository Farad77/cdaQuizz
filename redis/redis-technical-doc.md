# Redis Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, message broker, and queue. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglog, and geospatial indexes.

## Key Features

1. In-memory Data Store: Provides high performance by keeping data in RAM.
2. Persistence: Can save data to disk for durability.
3. Replication: Supports master-slave replication for high availability.
4. Transactions: Allows execution of a group of commands in a single step.
5. Pub/Sub: Implements the Publish/Subscribe messaging paradigm.
6. Lua Scripting: Supports server-side scripting.

## Data Types

1. Strings: Can store text or binary data up to 512MB.
2. Lists: Collections of string elements sorted by insertion order.
3. Sets: Unordered collections of unique strings.
4. Sorted Sets: Sets ordered by a score associated with each member.
5. Hashes: Maps between string fields and string values.
6. Bitmaps and BitFields: Allow bit-level operations.
7. HyperLogLog: Probabilistic data structure for counting unique items.
8. Streams: Append-only collections of map-like entries.

## Basic Commands

### Strings
```
SET key value
GET key
```

### Lists
```
LPUSH key value [value ...]
LRANGE key start stop
```

### Sets
```
SADD key member [member ...]
SMEMBERS key
```

### Hashes
```
HSET key field value
HGET key field
```

### Sorted Sets
```
ZADD key score member [score member ...]
ZRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]
```

## Advanced Features

### Transactions
```
MULTI
SET key1 value1
SET key2 value2
EXEC
```

### Pub/Sub
```
SUBSCRIBE channel
PUBLISH channel message
```

### Lua Scripting
```
EVAL "return redis.call('SET', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])" 1 mykey myvalue
```

## Persistence

Redis provides two persistence options:
1. RDB (Redis Database): Point-in-time snapshots
2. AOF (Append Only File): Logs every write operation

## Replication

Redis supports master-slave replication:
```
SLAVEOF master_ip master_port
```

## Clustering

Redis Cluster provides a way to run a Redis installation where data is automatically sharded across multiple Redis nodes.

## Security

Redis supports password authentication and SSL/TLS encryption.

## Use Cases

1. Caching
2. Session Store
3. Real-time Analytics
4. Leaderboards
5. Queues
6. Pub/Sub systems

## Performance Considerations

1. Use pipelining to send multiple commands in a single request.
2. Prefer hash structures for objects with many fields.
3. Use Redis benchmarking tools to test performance.
4. Monitor memory usage and use appropriate eviction policies.

## Comparison with Traditional Databases

- Redis is significantly faster for read and write operations.
- It's limited by available memory, unlike disk-based databases.
- Redis has simpler data structures and querying capabilities.
- It's often used in conjunction with traditional databases, not as a replacement.
