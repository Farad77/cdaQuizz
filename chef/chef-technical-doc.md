# Chef Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Chef is an automation platform that configures and manages infrastructure. It transforms infrastructure into code, allowing you to manage servers by writing scripts rather than manually configuring them.

## Key Concepts

### Recipes
Recipes are the fundamental configuration element of Chef. They are written in Ruby and describe a series of resources that should be in a particular state.

### Cookbooks
Cookbooks are the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution in Chef. They contain recipes, attributes, files, templates, and more.

### Resources
Resources represent a piece of system state and the steps needed to get that piece of system state into the desired state.

### Attributes
Attributes are settings that are defined in cookbooks and recipes, and then used to override the default settings on a node.

### Roles
Roles define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization.

### Data Bags
Data bags store global variables as JSON data. They are accessible from a Chef server and are used to store information like users, passwords, and more.

## Chef Architecture

Chef uses a client-server model:

1. Chef Server: The central store for your infrastructure's configuration data.
2. Chef Client (node): A system configured by Chef, where the Chef client runs.
3. Workstation: Where users create, test, and maintain cookbooks.

## Writing a Simple Recipe

Here's a simple recipe that ensures Apache is installed and running:

```ruby
package 'apache2' do
  action :install
end

service 'apache2' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end

file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  content '<html>
  <body>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
  </body>
</html>'
end
```

## Chef DSL

Chef uses a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing recipes:

### Conditionals
```ruby
if node['platform'] == 'ubuntu'
  package 'apache2'
elsif node['platform'] == 'centos'
  package 'httpd'
end
```

### Loops
```ruby
%w(apache2 mysql-server).each do |pkg|
  package pkg do
    action :install
  end
end
```

## Knife

Knife is a command-line tool that provides an interface between your local chef-repo and the Chef server.

## Test Kitchen

Test Kitchen is an integration tool for developing and testing infrastructure code on isolated target platforms.

## Chef Supermarket

Chef Supermarket is the community site for cookbooks. It provides a place to share cookbooks with the Chef community.

## Chef InSpec

InSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human-readable language for specifying compliance, security and policy requirements.

## Best Practices

1. Use version control for your Chef code
2. Write modular, reusable cookbooks
3. Use roles and environments to organize your infrastructure
4. Utilize Test Kitchen for testing your cookbooks
5. Use community cookbooks when possible
6. Keep your recipes idempotent
7. Use attributes to make your cookbooks more flexible
