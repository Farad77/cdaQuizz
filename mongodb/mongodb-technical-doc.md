# MongoDB Technical Documentation

## Introduction

MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It works on concept of collection and document, offering a flexible schema for storing and accessing data.

## Key Concepts

### Document
A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema, meaning that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure.

Example of a MongoDB document:
```json
{
   "_id": ObjectId("5099803df3f4948bd2f98391"),
   "name": "John Doe",
   "age": 35,
   "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Anytown",
      "country": "USA"
   },
   "hobbies": ["reading", "cycling"]
}
```

### Collection
A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database.

### Database
A database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system.

## MongoDB Architecture

MongoDB can be deployed in various architectures:

1. Standalone: A single MongoDB instance.
2. Replica Set: A group of MongoDB instances that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and high availability.
3. Sharded Cluster: A method for distributing data across multiple machines to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.

## Basic Operations

### Create (Insert)
To insert a document into a collection:
```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({name: "John", age: 30})
```

### Read (Query)
To find documents in a collection:
```javascript
db.collection.find({name: "John"})
```

### Update
To update a document in a collection:
```javascript
db.collection.updateOne({name: "John"}, {$set: {age: 31}})
```

### Delete
To delete a document from a collection:
```javascript
db.collection.deleteOne({name: "John"})
```

## Indexing in MongoDB

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, i.e., scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that match the query statement.

To create an index:
```javascript
db.collection.createIndex({name: 1})
```

## Aggregation Framework

MongoDB's aggregation framework is based on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into aggregated results.

Example of an aggregation pipeline:
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
   { $match: { status: "A" } },
   { $group: { _id: "$cust_id", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
])
```

## Data Modeling

Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. Collections do not enforce document structure. However, good schema design is crucial for performance and scalability.

Key considerations for data modeling in MongoDB:
1. Embed related data in a single document to reduce read operations.
2. Use references when dealing with large amounts of data or when data is updated frequently.
3. Avoid unbounded arrays.

## Replication

MongoDB replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple servers. It provides redundancy and increases data availability.

Key components of a replica set:
1. Primary Node: Receives all write operations.
2. Secondary Nodes: Maintain copies of the primary's data set.
3. Arbiter: Does not hold data, but participates in elections.

## Sharding

Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. It's MongoDB's approach to meeting the demands of data growth.

Key components of a sharded cluster:
1. Shards: Each shard contains a subset of the sharded data.
2. Config Servers: Store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster.
3. Mongos: Query routers that interface with client applications and direct operations to the appropriate shard(s).

## Security

MongoDB provides various features to secure your deployment:
1. Authentication: SCRAM, x.509 certificates, LDAP, Kerberos
2. Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
3. TLS/SSL encryption for client-server and inter-cluster communication
4. Encryption at Rest

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate write concern for your application's needs.
2. Design schemas with query patterns in mind.
3. Use indexes to improve query performance.
4. Monitor your database regularly.
5. Implement proper backup and recovery strategies.
6. Keep MongoDB and drivers up to date.
