# Travis CI Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket. It provides automated building, testing, and deployment of applications.

## Key Concepts

### Builds
A build is a group of jobs that execute in sequence. For example, a build might have two jobs, each testing a project with different versions of a programming language.

### Jobs
A job is an automated process that clones your repository into a virtual environment and then carries out a series of phases such as compiling your code, running tests, etc.

### Phases
Each job in Travis CI is made up of multiple phases:
1. Install: Install any dependencies required
2. Script: Run the build script
3. Deploy (optional): Deploy your code to your web server or application host

### Stages
Stages group jobs, and run jobs in each stage in parallel, but run one stage after another sequentially.

## Travis CI Configuration

Travis CI uses a file named `.travis.yml` in the root of your repository to define the build process.

Basic structure of a `.travis.yml` file:

```yaml
language: ruby
rvm:
 - 2.2
 - jruby
script: bundle exec rake test
```

## Build Lifecycle

The build lifecycle has two main parts:

1. Install: install any dependencies required
2. Script: run the build script

You can run custom commands before the installation phase, before the script phase, or after the script phase.

## Build Matrix

Travis CI can test your code with different configurations and environments. This is called a build matrix.

Example:
```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "2.7"
  - "3.4"
  - "3.5"
```

## Environment Variables

Travis CI allows you to define environment variables in your .travis.yml file:

```yaml
env:
  - DB=postgres
  - DB=mysql
```

## Secure Environment Variables

For sensitive data, you can encrypt environment variables:

```
travis encrypt MY_SECRET_ENV=super_secret --add env.global
```

## Deployment

Travis CI can automatically deploy your application after a successful build:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: "YOUR API KEY"
```

## Caching Dependencies

You can cache dependencies to speed up your build process:

```yaml
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.cache/pip
```

## Notifications

Travis CI can notify you about your build results through email, IRC, or webhooks.

```yaml
notifications:
  email:
    - one@example.com
    - other@example.com
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep your .travis.yml file simple and readable
2. Use build stages to structure complex builds
3. Utilize caching to speed up builds
4. Encrypt sensitive data
5. Use a build matrix to test against multiple configurations
6. Keep your build fast by running tests in parallel
