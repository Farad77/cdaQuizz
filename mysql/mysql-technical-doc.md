# MySQL Technical Documentation

## Introduction

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It's widely used for web applications and is a core component of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack.

## Key Features

1. ACID Compliance: Ensures data integrity and reliability.
2. Replication: Supports various replication types for high availability.
3. Partitioning: Allows tables to be split across multiple servers.
4. Stored Procedures: Supports server-side programming.
5. Triggers: Automated actions based on table events.
6. Views: Virtual tables based on the result of SQL statements.

## Basic Concepts

### Databases and Tables
- A MySQL server can host multiple databases.
- Tables are the main objects used to store data.

Basic table creation:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Data Types
MySQL supports various data types including:
- Numeric: INT, BIGINT, FLOAT, DECIMAL
- String: CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT
- Date and Time: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP
- Binary: BLOB, BINARY
- Spatial Data Types: GEOMETRY, POINT, POLYGON

### Indexes
Indexes improve query performance. Basic index creation:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_username ON users(username);
```

## SQL Basics

### SELECT
Retrieve data from tables:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

### INSERT
Add new rows to a table:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('johndoe', 'john@example.com');
```

### UPDATE
Modify existing rows:
```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
```

### DELETE
Remove rows from a table:
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

## Advanced Features

### Transactions
Group multiple operations:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

### Stored Procedures
Reusable SQL routines:
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllUsers()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users;
END //
DELIMITER ;

CALL GetAllUsers();
```

### Triggers
Automatically executed based on table events:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_user_update 
    BEFORE UPDATE ON users
    FOR EACH ROW 
SET NEW.updated_at = NOW();
```

### Views
Virtual tables based on SELECT statements:
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_login > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

## Performance Optimization

1. Proper indexing
2. Query optimization
3. Table partitioning
4. Configuration tuning (e.g., innodb_buffer_pool_size)
5. Regular ANALYZE TABLE and OPTIMIZE TABLE

## Backup and Recovery

- mysqldump: Logical backups
- MySQL Enterprise Backup: Hot physical backups
- Binary log for point-in-time recovery

## Security

- User authentication and privileges
- SSL/TLS for encrypted connections
- MySQL Enterprise Firewall
- Data masking and de-identification

## Replication

- Asynchronous replication
- Semi-synchronous replication
- Group Replication for multi-master topology

## Comparison with PostgreSQL

While both are powerful RDBMSs, they have some differences:
- MySQL is often considered easier to set up and manage
- PostgreSQL has more advanced features and stricter SQL compliance
- MySQL has traditionally been faster for read-heavy workloads
- PostgreSQL often performs better for complex queries and write-heavy workloads
